    <h1>Kyle Peart</h1>
    <p>
        I am a final-year undergraduate student with a strong interest in information technology and software development. 
        I am currently pursuing studies in computing-related disciplines, where I continue to develop skills in web 
        development, problem-solving, and system design. I am motivated by learning new technologies and applying them 
        to practical, real-world applications.
